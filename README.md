# image-gallery

## Still developing! ##

Only single version now ( version 3 ).

Other versions feel little too wonky. Requires too much HTML for viewer and thumbnails

### Limits ###
Folder structure only support 1 folder depth.

images/gallery/cake/ -> creates gallery named cake with images inside cake/ folder.

images/gallery/flower/ -> creates gallery named flower with images inside flower/ folder.

images/gallery/cake/creamcake/ -> fails.
